In India, Agriculture is the key point for survival. 


For agriculture, rainfall is most important. These days rainfall prediction has become a major problem. Prediction of rainfall gives awareness to people and know in advance about rainfall to take certain precautions to protect their crop from rainfall. 


Many techniques came into existence to predict rainfall. Machine Learning algorithms are mostly useful in predicting rainfall. Some of the major Machine Learning algorithms are  Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and such others.
